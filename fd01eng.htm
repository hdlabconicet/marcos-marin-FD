<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The word &quot;Philology,&quot; in its broad sense, is generally understood as the
study of texts, particularly those texts requiring the use of certain tools. Those
instruments include (but are not limited to) transcription, critical editing,
codicological study, application of the laws compiled in historical grammars to elucidate
textual quizzes, and placement of each work inside a tradition. The philological activity,
therefore, combines a technical character and a theoretical perspective, together with a
quantitative appreciation that makes it suitable for computational treatment. Moreover,
several developments in the storing of images have added to the previously restricted
philological possibilities (limited to writing) a new impulse, related to the history of
books and Art History, as applied to small objects.</p>

<p>Typologically, the scholar can distinguish data, procedures, and results, all of them
sharing a common quantitative basis. This presentation will be based on a typology of
procedures and results, followed by examples of each class. Procedures will be classified
as extensional, intensional, and selective. Results as primary or extractive, secondary or
differentiated, and tertiary or interpreted.</p>

<p>The examples given will allow the audience to appreciate the diverse efforts that
combine to produce results of different value, progressing from ordered lists of words, to
indexes, concordances, and furthermore, by applying electronic collatio and recensio to
obtaining critical editions, and formal glossaries to dictionary building.</p>

<p>Thus, the new Philology can be more ambitious that it was in older stages, and evolve
from accumulative criteria to selective and critical ones, until achieving the goal of the
Digital Textual Archive, in the widest sense, whose first step was climbed by ADMYTE, the
Digital Archive of Spanish Manuscripts and Texts, as early as 1992.</p>

<p>This presentation, therefore, continues the lead set by books such as the critical
edition of the 13th c. Spanish <em>Book of Alexandre</em> (1987), <em>Inform&aacute;tica y
Humanidades</em> (1994) and <em>El Comentario Filol&oacute;gico con Apoyo Inform&aacute;tico</em>
(1996), as well as that of ADMYTE (CDs issued in 1992, 1993, 1998), and points to new
goals open to scholars, in a field that pours old wine in new vessels.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Data</strong></p>

<p>Our starting point will be located in Buenos Aires, where an Argentinean group of
scholars, under my direction, is working in the cataloguing and studying of the
Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc collection, in the National Library. The project is supported by the
Bilateral Agreement between Spain and Argentina, and funded by a number of institutions<a
NAME="sup1"></a><a HREF="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in both countries.</p>

<p>Raymond Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc was one of the main French hispanists of all times. He
developed his activity mostly during the end of the 19th c. and the first third of the 20<sup>th</sup>.
In 1894 he founded the well known journal <em>Revue Hispanique,</em> where he published, under
different names, his editions of old texts, as well as substantial contributions to
Spanish studies. Many of the books that so came to light in those pages were part of his
personal library. After his death, that excellent collection went under the hammer in
1936. The catalogue of the auction was published, the content of the library was therefore
known by everybody<a NAME="sup2"></a><a HREF="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a><font
FACE="Times New Roman">. From that precise moment on, however, most scholars lost any
trace of a substantial number of those books, that were marked as &quot;lost&quot; in the
bibliographies, reference catalogues and data bases devoted to Medieval and Classical
Spanish. Nobody seemed to know who had bought more than one thousand and two hundred of
those books, and where they could actually be.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">It would not be wise to reveal now, prematurely, what
happened to those volumes, without first taking advantage of the expectation created to
explain what those Iberian bibliographical data bases are, what their meaning from a new
philological perspective is, and how we propose to present the contents of our libraries
and archives to scholars in the digital era.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In 1990, the Spanish Agency for the Celebrations of the
Quincentennial of the Discovery of America opened an Area of Language Industry. When the
Spanish authorities invited this speaker to take the reins of the Area, they had in mind
the work that was being done in the Science Center IBM-UAM, at the Autonomous University
of Madrid, whose main philological goal was the creation of UNITE, a package comprising
several programs for critical editing of texts, including not only the collatio, but also
a large part of the recensio<a NAME="sup3"></a><a HREF="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The
first result of the UNITE project had been published in 1987, as the critical edition of
an early 13<sup>th</sup> c. Spanish book, the <em>Libro de Alexandre</em><a NAME="sup4"></a><a
HREF="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Among the different projects supported by the Area, one,
ADMYTE, the Digital Archive of Spanish Manuscripts and Texts in CD-ROM, has been specially
relevant for Spanish Philology. ADMYTE was the result of the collaboration among several
institutions, in different countries. Some of the projects included in the CDs pre-existed
ADMYTE, and that made the Digital Archive feasible. In the field of bibliography, the name
was BOOST, <em>Bibliography of Old Spanish Texts</em>, which had reached by them its third
edition on paper, published by the Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies in Madison,
Wisconsin, and had become a basic tool for any library interested in Medieval books
written in Castilian Spanish, Catalan, or Galician, and Portuguese. Names as those of
professors Charles B. Faulhaber, Arthur L-F Askins, &Aacute;ngel G&oacute;mez Moreno, Harvey Sharrer,
Martha Shaffer or Gemma Avenoza are associated to it.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The difference between BOOST and Philobiblon, which is the
name of the electronic version, illustrates clearly a first issue in the debate between
old and modern Philology. BOOST had, as any printed book, a reduced number of indexes:
titles, authors, subjects. Philobiblon, which is implemented as a relational database in
Advanced Revelation, allows more than 350 fields. It also permits the interactive handling
of three different bibliographies: <em>BETA. Bibliograf&iacute;a Espa&ntilde;ola de Textos Antiguos</em>(developed
from the original <em>BOOST), BITECA, Bibliograf&iacute;a de Textos Catalans Antics</em>, and <em>BITAGAP,
Bibliografia de Textos Antigos Galegos e Portugueses</em><a NAME="sup5"></a><a
HREF="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. I will not insist on the differences between indexing a
book and browsing a database, because we all are well aware of it. It is actually more
interesting to offer a quick glimpse of the system, which is now available in two
versions. The shortest and easiest version to use is implemented for the World Wide Web,
its URL is: <a HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/PhiloBiblon/phhm.html">http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/PhiloBiblon/phhm.html</a>
. The largest version was distributed with ADMYTE-0, in 1993, and has been updated several
times since then, with new releases of the program, which runs as a DOS program, or as a
DOS window in a 32 bits operating system. It would be misleading also to limit ourselves
to consider that the advantage of a database on an indexed book is limited to the
possibility of including a larger number of fields. No. The main advantage is that it
allows, and even makes, the scholar to ask himself more questions, to plunge into many
details scattered around his data, that may now be ordered and related to other aspects of
his research.</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The question of a better implementation of the program and
the well-known limits of DOS should not concern us here today: it is an issue for computer
scientists to deal with. As philologists, we must realize the improvement implied by a
system that offers the possibility of relating any copy of a manuscript to the rest of the
copies, informing us not only of the basic details, such as author, date, copyist,
location, catalogue description and identification, number of known copies and their
location, titles, but also about the owners, persons related to the book or to any person
related to it, bibliography, with new links to any names mentioned in the bibliography,
and even more practical details, such as where is the library located, its address, phone,
fax and e-mail numbers, which facilities it offers, opening hours, and even how to address
the librarian, a courtesy sometimes not so irrelevant in the highly sophisticated Iberian
world.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Philobiblon, therefore, is a first model for descriptions
and primary access to the information to be considered when a team finds a huge deposit of
books, whose trace was lost by the scholarly community. The scholars involved in that
finding have, as their first goal, the need to make that information available as soon and
accurately as possible. This was actually the situation in Buenos Aires when, in 1996,
Arthur Askins and Harvey Sharrer, in their search of manuscripts for the databases
included in Philobiblon, particularly manuscripts of Portuguese authors, visited the new
building of the National Library in the Ag&uuml;ero street, a name probable auspicious, as
&quot;ag&uuml;ero&quot;, in Spanish, means &quot;omen&quot;. When looking at the card files in
the Sala del Tesoro, they noticed that several manuscripts carried the FD
mark. They then remembered all of a sudden the unknown destiny of the still missing
manuscripts of the Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc collection. The quest for the treasury had started in
the right place. They did not keep the finding for themselves, and communicated it to other
scholars, as Buenos Aires was currently hosting a conference of medievalists. However,
nobody paid special attention to the news, and, thanks to the collaboration established
between Arthur Askins and our team, since the days of ADMYTE, I took good note of the
information and started working in the Biblioteca Nacional, with the assistance of some of
my collaborators in Buenos Aires, with the aim of launching a joint research venture
sponsored by the two governments, as it is now the case. A catalogue is being written, and
will be published not only on paper, but also across the web, in electronic format, which
implies digital facsimiles of at least some chosen pages, and transcriptions of excerpts
of each manuscript, until a CD-ROM with the whole versions can be produced.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Our departing issue becomes now more concrete. We had
rediscovered, 60 years later, the whereabouts of a huge part of the books auctioned in
Paris in 1936. It is only fair to add immediately that it is not totally true that nobody
knew that the books were in Buenos Aires. At least four notes had been published since the
acquisition. They did not seem to hit the audience. The acquisition was duly reviewed in
the <em>Memoria</em> of the Biblioteca Nacional corresponding to 1936, and in 1937, in the
first issue of the <em>Revista de la Biblioteca Nacional,</em><a NAME="sup6"></a><a
HREF="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> published again under the direction of <a HREF="assets/img/FDMZZU02.jpg"><img SRC="assets/img/FDMZZU02.jpg"

Gustavo Mart&iacute;nez
Zuvir&iacute;a,<a NAME="sup7"></a><a HREF="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> after a long period of
silence following the publication of the last number of the <em>Anales de la Biblioteca
Nacional</em>, which had been directed by Paul Groussac. The copies entered in 1937 the
&quot;sala de reservados&quot;, presently <em>Sala del Tesoro</em>, as Colecci&oacute;n F-D<a
NAME="sup8"></a><a HREF="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>. In 1992 a new reference to the
collection<a NAME="sup9"></a><a HREF="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> was made, although it was
included in a publication with limited diffusion. After moving to the new location of the
Library, Hugo Acevedo<a NAME="sup10"></a><a HREF="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> wrote the
chapter on the history of the National Library of Argentina published in the joint volume
edited by the Association of Libraries of Spain and Latin America, <em>ABINIA</em>, where
he referred to the acquisition in 1936 and put the accent, among other bibliographical
treasures, on &quot;varias ediciones de <em>La Celestina&quot;</em>, with special mention
to the volume of &quot;Sevilla 1502&quot;, one of the three extant copies of that printing<a
NAME="sup11"></a><a HREF="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">When the collection was rediscovered in 1996, and its full
importance was duly acknowledged, there existed only two sources of information about it:
the old card files of 1937, whose information was very limited, and the more detailed,
albeit also restricted, information included in the catalogue of the auction. In the first
case, the card files, only the first of the several books often included inside the same
binding was mentioned. When a volume contains several books, there is no information of
its whole content on the card files. In the second source, the auction catalogue, there
was no indication of who had bought the books and, in a more concrete wise, of which books
had actually been bought by the Argentinean government in 1936. There was, therefore, no
possibility to know which was the identification and location given to them in the Library
shelves. Georgina Olivetto undertook the heavy task of preparing the lists of concordances
between the card files and the auction catalogue, with the valuable help of Librarian Hugo
Acevedo, perhaps the only person who really knows the deposits of the Biblioteca Nacional.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">With those tables in our hands, we could start preparing
the way to detail to the scientific community the contents of the collection. As I said,
many of the books were considered lost. The auction had taken place in 1936, times were
not peaceful after that date, neither in Spain nor in the rest of the world. Most people
had taken for granted that the books could have been destroyed. Even those who knew that
there was a Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc collection in Buenos Aires had no means to know of how many
books it consisted of, and which its condition was, unless they visited the Library and
investigated from the card files.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Although times are changing very quickly, editing the
catalogue in book format is still necessary. It is insufficient, though. We have to
establish a link between the old and the new Philology, again, by preparing a format that
could achieve three goals: being published in printed form, being incorporated into the
electronic catalogues of the Biblioteca Nacional that uses Micro-Isis as its cataloguing
database, and getting ready to be accessed through Internet. Another requirement was the
need for a system that includes text and pictures.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">We were aware of the existence of a group of the Text
Encoding Initiative that prepares an SGML proposal for the cataloguing of collections of
ancient books, which means that our system will have to be translated into that format in
the future. Philobiblon has evolved meanwhile from the DOS limited possibilities to its
new web presentation, Arthur Askins announces the preparation of a CD-ROM with a new
version, and Charles Faulhaber, as director of the Bancroft Library, in Berkeley, kindly
offered any collaboration needed for the development of our project, as we had already
done in the past. We opted for a text template, as the most suitable form for further
translations into the different sources envisaged. The template is included as <a
NAME="supA"></a><a HREF="#ApA"><em>Appendix A.</em></a> An HTML version is built
automatically from that source, the XML version becoming the immediate goal.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The kind of information suitable to be collected by a
printed catalogue is not enough. It has to be complemented in several ways. We cannot
detail all of them now, but their main spheres can be delineated. For the sake of this
presentation we shall speak of a hypertext version, not withstanding whether its concrete
form is HTML, XML or SGML. All of them, from the linguistic perspective, are dialects of
the same basic markup language. After opening the hypertext, the immediate options will
lead us towards the following lines. In the first place, the interrogation of the
database, to build our own indexes, according to the parameters we can choose by
interrelating the different fields of the template. Technically, it can be done with a
series of small programs or CGIs, implementing different search options. A second line can
take us to the text of the book itself, its transcription, preferably in paleographic
format. The third line will take us to the facsimile reproduction of the book, usually in
either compressed TIFF format, or JPEG.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">For those who know our previous work, it will be clear
that this implies an evolution of the ADMYTE format. A representation of the parallel
columns of text and facsimile, which allows an easy checking and correction of foreseeable
transcription mistakes is given in <a NAME="supB"></a><a HREF="#ApB"><em>Appendix B.</em></a>
A clear advantage is that the digital reproduction is much more accurate than human sight,
which means that we can store the information in a highly precise definition, whilst for
its presentation to the human eye a much reduced definition is enough. A thumb rule says
that it is sufficient to store the images at a resolution that doubles that of its
presentation. Storing at 600 dpi, for instance, will give clear printouts at 300 dpi, a
quality that improves clearly that of any photocopy. Digital reproduction, by the way,
implies no harm for the books themselves, quite differently of the suffering, both of the
bindings and of the actual pages, implied by the forced position imposed by the
photocopying, and the heat and strong light necessarily involved.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Until now we have presented facts related to data. Some
possibilities of information retrieval and further analysis will be dealt with in the
second part of this presentation.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><strong>Analysis</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Once we have proceeded to the presentation of the raw
data, the most important objective for any philologist will be their analysis. Any
computational analysis of texts is, by definition, quantitative. The whole matter consists
of knowing which elements of the binary code are in which positions and of comparing those
elements or those positions, or both, with other elements or positions. This is, of
course, an extensional definition, because it allows the definition of a set by its
elements. Together with the extensional definition, there are cases in which intensional
definitions are possible, definition after the properties that characterize the elements
belonging to the same set.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">In postulating a typology of Electronic Philology, we must
take into account the <em>data</em>, the <em>procedures</em>, and the <em>results.</em>
The <em>data</em>&nbsp;can be either <em>homogeneous</em>&nbsp;or <em>heterogeneous</em>.
In our case, the different types of fields and the need to deal with texts, but also with
images, points to heterogeneity as a characteristic of the philological data. That
characteristic makes necessary to develop standards that limit the presentation of the
data, in such a way that the effort made to collect them is not lost: data must be encoded
in a way that allows scholars to reuse them. The encoding of books in a catalogue, in our
case, involves structural description, and formal description as well, because each book
is, at least partially, treated as a unique copy.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The typology of procedures is more complex, and more
interesting, too, because the researcher is not only dependent on the data, but also on
his interests, the means and devices at his disposal, and also his limits.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">By straight <em>quantitative procedures</em> we understand
those aimed at obtaining a mass of results justified simply by its dimension. Counting is
a typical case of a quantitative procedure. A few years ago, it was utterly complicated to
know the number of words, or vowels, or particular narks, that constituted a text. Any
word processor solves in our days this difficulty, adding much more information. We are so
used to it, that we do not realize how easy it is now to know that in the dictionary <em>Latinum-Hispanicum</em>
by Nebrija, included in ADMYTE-I, there are 240 words that appear more than 20 times
(between 21 and 3,659, to be precise), or that the famaous Spanish epico poem of the 12<sup>th</sup>
c. <em>Cantar de Mio Cid</em> contains 439 instances of the word <em>&Ccedil;id</em>&nbsp;with
cedilla and only two of the same word with a simple <em>c</em>. Quantitative procedures,
however, are not limited to counting, they can include any procedure that considers the
data following strictly the extensional characterization of a set, for instance, when
comparing two files to know whether they are or not two instances of the same text. This
activity must not be confounded with the <em>collatio</em>, which involves more complex
considerations.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Searches, contrasts, including the collatio, and all
aspects involving an intensional characterization, must be classified as <em>qualitative
procedures</em>. Those procedures are characterized by a common feature in the definition
of the compared or related elements, therefore, they take into account features that
belong to the compared elements themselves. ADMYTE, f. i., includes a formal glossary, a
context-free glossary of lemmata and forms that permits an extremely productive
association among variants of a lemma that differ graphemically and also morphologically.
The system is limited by a rigidly established hierarchy of associations between forms and
their possible lemmata, but has proven its usefulness as a general tool for the analysis
of the highly polymorphic medieval texts. Another significant example of a qualitative
procedure is that of the <em>collatio</em>&nbsp;in UNITE, our system for critical editing
of texts. The new UNITE release for 32 bits systems collates simultaneously up to 50
versions of any ASCII text, in any language, in either prose or verse (as can be seen in
our <a NAME="supC"></a><a HREF="#ApC"><em>Appendix C.)</em></a> It also provides the
scholar with a rich panoply of results, which will be considered shortly, because, as a
part of the <em>recensio,</em> they are included in the last type of procedures.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The exploitation of huge textual resources has driven to
the development of complex information retrieval systems, and rich query languages. These
are characterized because they act on a mass of data, which for the sake of the exposition
we shall call a <em>database,</em> extracting from those data entities or references whose
value is given in terms of quantity, for instance, how many pages contain the word
&quot;Cid&quot;. The entities or references defined in those terms of quantity are called <em>operands.</em>
Those operands can be related and combined. An <em>operator</em> relates two operands and
offers as the result of that combination the combined value of the two operands related,
which now may serve as a new operand to be related to another operand again. Any procedure
that associates, for instance a lemma with its forms, operates by building lists of the
elements, its operands, associated by the operator = (<em>association</em>). Until this
point we are limited to the qualitative procedure, by simply searching and locating. </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">However, we can go further, by assigning a value to an
operand, such as an integer <em>n</em> that gives us the possibility to make searches of
words separated by <em>n,</em> or by using the typically selective operators, the <em>boolean
operators (.or, and, .not).</em> This third class, therefore, groups the so called <em>selective
procedures</em>. The main application of selective procedures for philologists goes far
beyond the establishment of ranges or the application of boolean operators, though. It
resides, from our point of view, in the automatization of the <em>recensio</em> from the <em>collatio</em>.
Once again, the advantage for the scholar consists not only of the amount of data
processed in a very short time, but of the number of possibilities delivered for selection
by the application of quantitative and qualitative procedures.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">UNITE offers the possibility to produce either a short
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the processes involved in the <em>collatio,</em> or a much larger file with an
extended version of the whole development, both partially reproduced in our <a NAME="supD"></a><a
HREF="#ApD"><em>Appendix D.</em></a> The objective of a mostly automatic <em>recensio</em>
is closer everyday.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">We have considered the data and the procedures. It is also
possible to categorize the <em>results</em> in three types, separating that which is <em>accumulative</em>
from that which is <em>select</em> and that which is <em>critical</em> in the three types
of <em>primary, secondary,</em>&nbsp;and <em>tertiary</em> results.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">As <em>primary results</em> we consider those which are
purely extractive or accumulative. Any list of words, sorted in any order, can be a good
example. Most word processors, and even basic commands of operating systems, offer that
possibility. More complex packages, such as TACT, allow for changes in the distribution of
the graphemes in different scales: Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Traditional Spanish. It is
convenient to link those programs with routines that allow the cleaning. and even the
interpretation, of certain tags. An example could be the tag <em>remark {RMK:}</em> in the
texts coded following the HSMS system. Between the braces of that tag words are included
which express the opinions or doubts of the transcriber, and therefore do not belong to
the original text. As observations written by the transcribers, they can even be in a
language that differs from the language of the text that is being transcribed. This is
often the case when American scholars transcribe Old Spanish texts: their remarks use to
be written in English. If a list of words is produced automatically, disregarding that
issue, the <em>foreign</em> words are also included. No need to give a concrete example of
that failure in this moment, but it could be produced, if required.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Primary results conform a mass from which <em>secondary
results</em> can be obtained. It can be interpreted as that tertiary can be <em>selected </em>from
secondary. A clear case can be the list of selected words obtained from a whole list of
words. The list so selected constitutes the base to prepare <em>kwic, indexes, </em>and <em>concordances.</em>
There are many examples of commands, such as <em>grep</em> in UNIX, instructions or
programs that help obtain secondary results: <em>Word Cruncher, OCP, TACT</em> are names
that come easily to the mind. However, it is remarkable how many colleagues do not feel at
ease with those packages, and how much there is still to be done to familiarize scholars
with those valuable tools<a NAME="sup12"></a><a HREF="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>. In the
field of editing, a typically select result is the result of the <em>collatio</em>, the
file containing the so-called <em>unified text</em>, i.e., those elements extracted and
grouped automatically by the program.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><em>Tertiary</em> or <em>critical</em> <em>results</em>
are obtained from the selected ones, following an exact pattern. In this case, the human
interpretation is crucial, and the human factor needed. When we use a concordance or an
index to build a dictionary, or the results of the <em>collatio</em> to prepare a critical
edition, we are aiming at critical results. It goes without saying that different types of
results can be combined in a final product, as when we prepare a critical edition, with an
index and a list of words ordered by frequency.</font></p>

<p><strong>Back to the beginning</strong></font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">Once we have designed the broad perspectives of Electronic
Philology, we can go back to the practical example with which we started our presentation.
The Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc collection constitutes an excellent test for many of the issues we
have presented, in a somewhat simplified fashion.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">The application of the lessons learned from Philobiblon or
ADMYTE seems quite straightforward. The publication of the catalogue and the preparation
of a CD-Rom with facsimile and transcription being starting points in that kind of task.
However, I would not finish this presentation without insisting in what seems to be the
core of our purpose. Electronic Philology is not only a way to make things faster and
inventories more accurate. It is not a tool. It is also, and more deeply, a change in our
attitude. For certain aspects we must understand that limiting ourselves to a well chosen
set, a well designed corpus, for instance, can be suitable. There is also, however, the
unlimited capability to deal with the whole: the whole Text, in a comprehensive corpus,
the whole Work, in a comparison of all versions of the same work, the total number of
copies of a manuscript, all variants of a construction, a formula, a sentence.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">That is the reason why a typology is necessary, to adapt
the means to the goals, the efforts to the needs. Philology has been, for centuries, the
main humanist activity. Many people are still looking at computers as enemies of the
intellectual activity that characterizes the approach to texts since the beginning. We are
not convincing them by saying that we get more accurate accounts of words, or several
thousands of examples. What is different is not the quantity, it is the new insights, the
new questions that we can ask, even more than the old questions that we can answer, a fact
not to be forgotten, anyhow. What is also different is the facility with which we can
share our resources and our knowledge with scholars all over the world. The
Foulch&eacute;-Delbosc collection had been forgotten for sixty years, in spite of notices
published in different printed sources, as we remarked. The situation, in less than two
years, has changed dramatically: in a few months, more than one thousand texts, offering a
richer view of Spanish Culture, will be ready for scholars to publish them, to study them,
to connect them with other versions or with other aspects of human written production.
That goal can be achieved only through the computer, and it is also the computer the ideal
tool to make the texts themselves available to the large public, and also for research,
without endangering them by direct unnecessary exposure. The ideal of preservation and
usage is feasible thanks to the new techniques. Going beyond, discovering the new
frontiers of Philology, does not depend on the computer, it depends on us, the scholars.</font></p>

<p><a NAME="N_7_"></a><a HREF="#sup7">7</a>. Whose pen name was Hugo Wast. Born in C&oacute;rdoba in October 30, 1883, he was
appointed Director of the Biblioteca Nacional by the <em>de facto</em> government of
general Jos&eacute; F&eacute;lix Uriburu, on October 30,1931, and remained until March 30, 1955, with the exception of two very short periods in 1941 and 1943. During the first of them exerced as
Federal Interventor in the Catamarca province. During the second he was the Minister of
Justice and Public Instruction in another <em>de facto,</em> government, that of general
Pedro Pablo Ram&iacute;rez. He died in 1962. Cfr. Horacio Salas, <em>Biblioteca Nacional Argentina,</em> Buenos Aires: Manrique Zago ediciones, 1997, pages 80-82.

<p><a NAME="N_8_"></a><a HREF="#sup8">8</a>. At that moment they were taken care of,
catalogued and included in the card files of the Reserved Room. Then their trace was
almost lost, as I said. In any case, a reference was included by Milton A. Buchanan in his "Bibliographical Notes," <i>Hispanic Review,</i> 9, 1941, 228-230. When I and Ver&oacute;nica Zum&aacute;rraga visited the Library in 1990, trying
to prepare an ADMYTE CD-rom with manuscripts and old printed books of the Biblioteca
Nacional, at those times under the direction of Mr. Casti&ntilde;eira de Dios, still in the
Calle M&eacute;xico, nobody could give us any information nor assistance. Even those who had the
vague idea of the existence of a collection of ancient books, had never actually seen
them, with the exceptions of those who could write the notes referred to in this
presentation. Nevertheless, when a substantial part of the old funds of the Library was
microfilmed, most of the F-D books were preserved in this way also. Even if the quality of
the filming is not excellent, particularly in the case of manuscripts, and microfilms do
not improve with the pass of time, that basic step was taken.</p>
